land used for our parks and facilities as once being home to Native Americans who prospered here as the first
stewards of the Grosse Point area, a prominent geographic feature that aided travel along the shore of Lake
Michigan for centuries. It was a crossroads of cultures, safeguarding lake travel, enhancing communication
between people and sharing of knowledge. It is in this spirit that the District continues in its stewardship
of the Grosse Point area and lighthouse.</p><p class="indent">The Lighthouse Park District of Evanston has its history in the North East Park District that was established
in Evanston in 1929 as a local unit of government within Illinois. Its formation was in response to residents
who were concerned about the preservation or loss of park lands. In 1935, the District became responsible for
administration of the Grosse Point Lighthouse site and later became the Lighthouse Park District to honor
this historically significant maritime structure. District boundaries can be seen in this
<a href="/assets/pdfs/lighthouse-park-district.pdf">map</a>. Over the years residents of the District, through their taxes, have helped to preserve park property and
the lighthouse. See the District's
<a href="/assets/pdfs/202406-tax-agency-report.pdf">Tax Agency Report</a>
from the Office of the County Clerk. Due to District efforts, Grosse Point Lighthouse was designated a
National Historic Landmark by the United States Government, the first such landmark designation of a
lighthouse west of the Atlantic Ocean. A schedule of public meetings held by the District board can be found
in
<a href="/announcements.html">Announcements</a>.</p><h3 class="underline">Mission Statement</h3><p class="indent">It is the mission of the Lighthouse Park District of Evanston to preserve, maintain, and provide safe parks
and built facilities under District stewardship for area residents and the general public; to provide
courteous public service; to demonstrate a professional commitment to preserve and provide safe, responsible
public programming of Grosse Point Lighthouse consistent with its designation by the U.S. Department of the
Interior as a National Historic Landmark; to engage other organizations in a spirit of cooperation to better
serve the needs of resources under District management.</p><h3 class="underline"><a href="/assets/images/pages/park-district/Referendum2016.png" target="_blank">Referendum Material</a></h3></main><footer></footer></body></html>
