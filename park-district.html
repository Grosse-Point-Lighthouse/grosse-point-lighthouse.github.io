in Evanston in 1929 as a local unit of government within Illinois. Its formation was in response to residents
who were concerned about the preservation or loss of park lands. In 1935, the District became responsible for
administration of the Grosse Point Lighthouse site and later became the Lighthouse Park District to honor
this historically significant maritime structure. District boundaries can be seen in this
<a href="/assets/pdfs/lighthouse-park-district.pdf">map</a>.</p><p class="indent">Over the years residents of the District, through their
taxes, have helped to preserve park property and the lighthouse. Due to District efforts, Grosse Point
Lighthouse was designated a National Historic Landmark by the United States Government, the first such
landmark designation of a lighthouse west of the Atlantic Ocean. A schedule of public meetings held by the
District board can be found in
<a href="announcements.html">Announcements</a>.</p><h3 class="underline">Mission Statement</h3><p class="indent">It is the mission of the Lighthouse Park District of Evanston to preserve, maintain, and provide safe parks
and built facilities under District stewardship for area residents and the general public; to provide
courteous public service; to demonstrate a professional commitment to preserve and provide safe, responsible
public programming of Grosse Point Lighthouse consistent with its designation by the U.S. Department of the
Interior as a National Historic Landmark; to engage other organizations in a spirit of cooperation to better
